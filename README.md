## Hi there 👋

I am a front-end developer and creative coder focused on crafting interactive and visually engaging interfaces. I build smooth animations, dynamic user experiences, apps, and interfaces that feel alive. My work sits at the intersection of design, web development, and experimental coding.

## About Me

I enjoy turning ideas into experiences that are both functional and visually striking. I approach coding as a medium for creativity, experimenting with motion, interactivity, and game-like elements. My projects combine modern front-end frameworks with creative coding tools to explore new ways users interact with digital products.

## Skills

- Front-end development with React, Next.js, Typescript, JavaScript  
- CSS, SCSS, and Tailwind for modern and responsive layouts  
- Interactive animations using CSS, GSAP, Framer Animations, and Three.js.
- Building apps, from prototypes to full-featured web applications   
- Game development fundamentals and playable web | application experiences

## Projects

### Apps and Interfaces
Built apps and dynamic interfaces with animations that respond to user interactions, including hover effects, transitions, and motion-based feedback.

### Animation Experiments
Created visual experiments using p5.js and Three.js to explore motion, physics, and interaction design.

### Web-based Games
Developing small interactive games to combine front-end skills with game mechanics and user engagement.

## Current Focus

I am expanding my work in app development and game development while continuing to push the boundaries of interactive and animated web experiences. I am experimenting with new frameworks, 3D interactions, and creative ways to engage users.
