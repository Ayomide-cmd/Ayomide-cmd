# Hi there, I am Stephanie.

I am a front-end developer and creative coder focused on crafting interactive and visually engaging interfaces. I build smooth animations, dynamic user experiences, apps, and interfaces that feel alive. My work sits at the intersection of design, web development, and experimental coding.

## About Me

I transform ideas into interactive experiences, blending motion, interactivity, and game-like elements. By combining modern front-end frameworks with creative coding tools, I explore innovative ways for users to engage with digital products.

## Projects

### Apps and Interfaces
Built apps and dynamic interfaces with animations that respond to user interactions, including hover effects, transitions, and motion-based feedback.

### Animation Experiments
Created visual experiments using p5.js and Three.js to explore motion, physics, and interaction design.

### Web-based Games
Developing small interactive games to combine front-end skills with game mechanics and user engagement.

## Current Focus

I am expanding my work in app development and game development while continuing to push the boundaries of interactive and animated web experiences. I am experimenting with new frameworks, 3D interactions, and creative ways to engage users.
